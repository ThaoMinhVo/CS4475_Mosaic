# Computational Photography Final Project (Picture Mosaic)

We've created a program in Python with OpenCV that takes in an image and creates a mosaic of that image that is comprised of many other images. 


## Instructions 
- Create a folder called "resized" in your directory.
- Put your source image in the main directory and rename it to "image1.jpg" (can also be in .jpeg or .png format). 
- Place all the images you want to make the mosaic out of in the "images" folder. 

### Run the Program
Open up Terminal / Command Prompt and cd to the directory where these files are located. Then run

    python mosaic.py
